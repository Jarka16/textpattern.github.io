# Diagnostics panel

The Diagnostics panel is important for troubleshooting problems with your Textpattern installation, such as misconfigurations you might discover when installing or upgrading to a new version. The panel can also be useful for troubleshooting functional problems you inadvertently introduce when extending the system, modifying the `.htaccess` file, or some other slight of hand.

## Diagnostic info display

The actual diagnostics information is displayed in the **Diagnostics info** region at the bottom of the panel display. The volume of details displayed may be set to 'Low' (the default) or 'High', which you can toggle using the **Detail** selection control under the info display field.

### Low info display

Low diagnostics info begins with a set of data values about your installation and server technology. These values and their descriptions are described in the following list:

Textpattern version
: The version you currently have installed.

Last update
: The date/time you last updated your installation.

Site URL
: Your domain name and top-level domain (i.e. `example.com`). Corresponds with 'Site URL' setting in the 'Site' section of the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel#site-url).

Admin URL
: The Textpattern admin interface URL. This is typically the `/textpattern` directory from the Site URL (i.e. `example.com/textpattern`).

Document root
: The path to the web server's public (document root) directory, specifically.

$path_to_site
: The path to wherever your installation is (e.g. in document root or in a subdirectory thereof).

Textpattern path
: The path to your installation's `/textpattern` directory.

Article URL pattern
: The pattern of URL type you set. Corresponds with the 'Article URL pattern' setting in the 'Site' section of the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel#article-url-pattern).

Production status
: The status of your site: Live, Testing or Debugging.

Temporary directory path
: The path of your `/tmp` directory relative to document root.

PHP version
: The version number of your PHP instance.</td>

GD Graphics Library
: The version number of your GD Graphics Library install.

Server time zone
: The server's 'default time zone'; determined by a [specific order of preferences](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-get.php).

Server local time
: The local date/time of your web server (`yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`).

Daylight Savings Time enabled?
: Whether Daylight Savings Time is enabled (`0`=no, `1`=yes). Corresponds with the 'Daylight Savings Time enabled?' setting in the 'Site' section of the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel#daylight-savings-time-enabled).

Automatically adjust Daylight Saving Time setting?
: Whether Textpattern will adjust DST automatically (`0`=no, `1`=yes). Corresponds with the 'Automatically adjust Daylight Saving Time setting?' setting in the 'Site' section of the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel#automatically-adjust-daylight-saving-time-setting).

Time zone (GMT offset in seconds)
: Your time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Corresponds with the 'Time zone' setting in the 'Site' section of the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel#time-zone). The output includes an offset value in parentheses, which helps developers determine if time-specific problems might stem from a wrong or outdated [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).

MySQL
: The version number and build of your MySQL (or derivative) database server.

Database server time
: The database server time. Note this can be the same as the server local time, or different if the database is located on another host.

Database server time offset
: The time offset between the database server and the server local time.

Database server time zone
: todo:explanation

Database session time zone
: todo:explanation

Locale
: The language and character set you have configured.

Site / Admin language
: Language designations for the front-side and admin-side areas.

Web server
: Your web server type (e.g. Apache, Nginx).

PHP server API
: How the web server interfaces with PHP. For Apache servers, this may me `mod_php` or similar. For Nginx, this may be `fpm-fcgi` (PHP-FPM or FastCGI).

PHP SSL version
: The SSL/TLS library used by PHP. Note this may differ from the sytem SSL/TLS library.

RFC 2616 headers
: todo:explanation

Server OS
: The name and version number of the server's operating system.

Admin-side theme
: The name and version number of the active administration side theme. The default is 'Hive'.

Active plugins
: A comma-separated list of all plugins (with version numbers) that are installed *and<* turned on.

For Apache servers (and derivatives), the installation and server data is followed by the contents of your `.htaccess` file (from the installation directory). For purposes here we show the [file contents from the current version code](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/blob/main/.htaccess) below:

~~~ apacheconf
# BEGIN Textpattern

#DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    # Enable the `FollowSymLinks` option below if it isn't already.
    #Options +FollowSymlinks

    #RewriteBase /relative/web/path/

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^(.+) - [PT,L]

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
    RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php

    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  !^$
    RewriteRule .* - [E=REMOTE_USER:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_mime.c>
    AddType image/svg+xml  svg svgz
    AddEncoding gzip       svgz
</IfModule>

# For additional Apache-compatible web server configuration settings to enhance
# site performance and security, we recommend:
# https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/dist/.htaccess

# END Textpattern
~~~

Over time your `.htaccess` file may change as you add your own `mod_rewrite` rules, or whatever, and the changes will reflect in the diagnostics info display.

### High info display

High diagnostics info display includes the Low info above, but adds the following information:

Charset (default/config)
: If you don't see a lot of 'UTF-8' values on these `character_set` items, you might want ask yourself why not.

character_set_client
: todo:explanation

character_set_connection
: todo:explanation

character_set_database
: todo:explanation

character_set_filesystem
: todo:explanation

character_set_results
: todo:explanation

character_set_server
: todo:explanation

character_set_system
: todo:explanation

character_sets_dir
: todo:explanation

{n} Tables
: {n} being the number of Textpattern tables that exist in your installation (a default install has 17, anything more is from plugins or other extensions you've added); the value also indicates if tables are 'OK' or not.

{n}Â Custom fields
: {n} being the number of custom fields; value also indicates name of all counted fields.

PHP extensions
: List of extension names/versions your web host has enabled.

pretext_data
: Value is a piece of code; useful for developers to evaluate.

{/textpattern files, not shown here}
: List of Textpattern configuration files from the `/textpattern` directory; indicates file path, revision number, and MD5 Checksum hash number.

The last item above reflects a long list of Textpattern configuration files which makes up the end of the 'High' info data shown.

## Pre-flight checks

The **Pre-flight checks** region, at top of the panel is where diagnostic feedback messages appear. There are four kinds of feedback messages: success (green), information (blue), warning (yellow), and error (red).

### Success (green)

**There is only one green message:**

All checks passed!
{: .alert-block .success}

This message displays when you successfully address and/or troubleshoot all, blue, yellow, and red feedback messages that might exist. *Go green!*

### Information (blue)

Blue messages are informing you of something you might like to know. They're not necessarily functional problems you need to troubleshoot.

**There are four possible blue messages:**

New Textpattern version {version} available for download.
{: .alert-block .information}

It's saying you're not using the latest stable release, where {version} will be the latest version number. The first data item in the 'Low' **Diagnostics info** display described above will indicate your current working version. Because this is a blue message, you don't *have* to upgrade (yet) but it's good practice to do so for [security](/administration/security) reasons, if nothing else.

Clean URLs are only supported on Apache, use at your own risk.
{: .alert-block .information}

It's saying you're *not* using an Apache web server. The assumption is that you know what you're doing so you can ignore this message. It goes away if you ever switch to Apache.

File uploads are disabled.
{: .alert-block .information}

This appears if the permissions you have set on your *files* folder in the installation tree is read only. The assumption is that you've consciously made this choice, so you can ignore this message. If you make the files folder writable, it will go away.[^1]

There was a problem trying to connect to the RPC server. Please try again later.
{: .alert-block .information}

You may get this if you're working on a local install and not connected to the internet. Your local install is trying to ping the RPC server and has no internet connection to do so.

### Warning (yellow)

Warnings are not critical, per se, and sometimes can even be cascading[^2] or false.[^3] But when warnings are accurate, something needs resolved in order to work correctly, reliably, or securely.

**Several warning messages are possible:**

DNS lookup failed: {site URL}.
{: .alert-block .warning}

This means the 'Site URL' preference value in the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel) is probably incorrect; possibly the wrong name, a spelling mistake, or missing altogether. Check the value and make sure it's entered exactly like this, `example.com`, replacing your domain name and subdirecrory where appropriate.

Site URL preference might be incorrect: {site URL}.
{: .alert-block .warning}

Similar to the previous message, this is suggesting the 'Site URL' as set [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel) does not match the actual URL you use to visit your website.

Clean URL test failed.
{: .alert-block .warning}

This could appear for different reasons and may not be a problem, per se. Troubleshoot other messages first and it may go away too. If not, it might be caused by the PHP configuration setting of `allow_url_fopen`, or some other hosting issue.

Site URL has a trailing slash.
{: .alert-block .warning}

This means your 'Site URL' preference value in the [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel) has an ending forward slash on it like this, `example.com/`. Tsk-tsk. Remove the slash.

{path} still exists.
{: .alert-block .warning}

This means you need to remove the `/textpattern/setup` folder from the web server; {path} will be replaced with the actual folder path respective to your installation.

Image directory is read-only.
{: .alert-block .warning}

This means permissions on your `/images` folder needs changed before you can add any images to it; change permissions to chmod 755 or 711.[^1]

No temporary directory defined.
{: .alert-block .warning}

todo:explanation

Your PHP installation is missing the <code>mail()</code> function. Therefore no emails can be sent from Textpattern, which limits certain functionality.
{: .alert-block .warning}

todo:explanation

Your version of PHP has known security vulnerabilities. Please turn <code>register_globals</code> off or update to a newer PHP version.
{: .alert-block .warning}

todo:explanation

Some Textpattern files have been modified.
{: .alert-block .warning}

todo:explanation

You are running a development version of Textpattern on a live server.
{: .alert-block .warning}

Means you're installation version is a future development version, not the latest stable release. This would be okay for local testing, but not recommended for a live production site online.

The following PHP functions (which may be necessary to run Textpattern) are disabled on your serverâ¦
{: .alert-block .warning}

If you see this message, it will be followed by a number of PHP functions that are disabled on your web server. Textpattern needs certain functions enabled to work correctly, while other functions, if disabled, can be ignored. See section below, [Diagnostic reporting on PHP functions](#diagnostic-reporting-on-php-functions), for more about which function are needed or not.

Site URL preference might be incorrect.
{: .alert-block .warning}

This could either mean you do not have the right 'Site URL' path set in [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel), or, in the case of upgrading, you still need to update your `index.php` and/or `.htaccess` files (see next message). This could also be a false error. For example, symlinks cannot be correctly recognized, so you might get this error even if there's no true problem. Unless you are experiencing real technical issues, you shouldn't worry too much about this feedback message if it doesn't go away. Understandably that is not satisfying advice.

Clean URL data test failed.
{: .alert-block .warning}

todo:explanation

Clean URL test failed.
{: .alert-block .warning}

todo:explanation

### Error (red)

Red messages mean something critical appears to be wrong and you need to troubleshoot it immediately.

**Possible red messages include:**

Textpattern requires at least version {version} of PHP to be installed on your server
{: .alert-block .error}

todo:explanation

index.php is inaccessible.
{: .alert-block .error}

This suggests your `index.php` file is not available, is not the right version, or that your 'Site URL' is set wrong in [Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel). It could also mean the `index.php` file was not updated for whatever reason during a recent upgrade. Update the file using the one from the [current Textpattern release](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/releases) and refresh diagnostics.

.htaccess file is missing.
{: .alert-block .error}

This concerns the `.htaccess` file, but doesn't necessarily mean the file is missing; the message usually appears if you are trying to use one of the âcleanâ URL settings, and you have one of the previous diagnostic issues with the wrong path or have a missing `index.php` file. Take care of those issues first and this message may disappear. If that does not work, then definitely check to see if you even have an *.htaccess* file. If the file is there, then either replace it from the [current Textpattern release](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/releases), or select the help link next to this particular message and replace the contents of your existing `.htaccess` file with the indicated rewrite rules in the help dialog.

`$path_to_site` is inaccessible.
{: .alert-block .error}

This means either one or both of the previous diagnostics are a problem. Follow the troubleshooting procedures for them accordingly, and this problem will likely go away.

{dirtype} is not writable.
{: .alert-block .error}

todo:explanation

Apache module mod_rewrite is not installed.
{: .alert-block .error}

todo:explanation

Old placeholder file is in the way
{: .alert-block .error}

This likely means you have created an actual folder in your server file tree that shares a name with a *section* you created in the [Sections panel](/administration/sections-panel), or vice versa. This can break your site. You need to rename or remove one or the other.

Missing files
{: .alert-block .error}

todo:explanation

The following errors were detected in your MySQL tables
{: .alert-block .error}

todo:explanation

Temporary directory path and Plugin cache directory path should **not** match.
{: .alert-block .error}

This means paths to your plugin cache and `tmp` directory locations are the same. Neither should be web accessible, but if you set them to the same location, a temp file could overwrite a plugin, and that would be bad. Create a different folder location for your plugin cache.

## Diagnostic reporting on PHP functions

Textpattern requires certain PHP functions to be enabled for your website to work properly, or to work at all. Your website administrator or web host will be in control of these, and may have certain functions turned off for security reasons.

Diagnostics can tell you if any of these necessary functions are disabled. You'll see this pre-flight check warning:

The following PHP functions (which may be necessary to run Textpattern) are disabled on your serverâ¦
{: .alert-block .warning}

If so, compare the indicated functions with those in the table below to see if any match and thus need to be enabled.

### Functions used by Textpattern

The following functions are used by Textpattern. If your diagnostics reports any of these as *disabled*, you need to get in touch with your web server administrator or web host and explain why you need them turned on (for your Textpattern site to work). Point them to this page, if you want. If they won't help you, find a more suitable web host, because there is no real reason to disable these functions:

`apache_get_modules`
: Helps determine whether clean URLs could be used at setup, and for diagnostics info.

`apache_get_version`
: Helps provide diagnostics info regarding clean URLs.

`parse_ini_file`
: Language features, even if English is used.

`php_sapi_name`
: Determines whether PHP is running as an Apache module or CGI. Used for sending header information appropriate to the platform.

`php_uname`
: Provides diagnostics info regarding the server's operating system.

`set_time_limit`
: Makes sure PHP does not timeout before installation, updates (including language string changes), and file downloads can be completed.

### Functions not used by Textpattern

These functions are *not* used by Textpattern.[^4] If diagnostics reports one or more of these functions as disabled, you may safely ignore the message, because they do not affect Textpattern's operation in any way.

* `apache_child_terminate`
* `apache_getenv`
* `apache_note`
* `apache_setenv`
* `chgrp`
* `chown`
* `close_log`

* `symlink`
* `syslog`
* `system`
* `system_exec`
* `virtual`
* `wget`

[Next: Preferences panel](/administration/preferences-panel)

[^1]: **Folder permissions:** A chmod setting of 755 or 711 should work to make a folder writable, and is secure. A lot of people have trouble setting these values, however, and need to use a chmod of 777, which has [security implications](https://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=26613). The discrepancy is due to how Apache directives are configured on the web server, which means you may have to ask your server administrator or web host to change the directives. If they won't do it, it might be time to find a new web host, because no web host should force you to operate your site insecurely.

[^2]: **Cascading problems:** Sometimes the existence of one yellow or red issue can be the cause of another, so be sure to reload the Diagnostics panel as you resolve each yellow or red issue; you might find it eliminates another in the process.

[^3]: **False problems:** On rare occasions, yellow and red messages have been known to appear but not go away when addressed as instructed by their help information. Textpattern developers have indicated this can happen in odd situations, and it's a false reading nearly every time, meaning there isn't anything to worry about. If you ever have this problem and can't seem to resolve it, post about it in the [Textpattern Forum Troubleshooting section](https://forum.textpattern.com/viewforum.php?id=67) and someone will try to help.

[^4]: If you discover any functions named in your feedback message that are not listed above, create a new topic in the [Textpattern Forum Troubleshooting section](https://forum.textpattern.com/viewforum.php?id=67) and post the 'High' diagnostics info so someone can help you determine if the function is necessary or not.
