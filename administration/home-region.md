# Home region

The Home administration region is not an out-of-the-box feature. It appears to the higher [user roles](/administration/user-roles-and-privileges) if any of the administration-side plugins that employ it are installed.

When relevant, the Home administration region will be seen in the administration navigation from all administration-side views *except* when you are in context of the [Plugins panel](/administration/plugins-panel) even for the administrator. This behaviour ensures being able to safely deactivate and/or remove outdated or buggy plugins if they are causing problems. To access the Home administration region from the Plugins panel, move to anywhere else in the administration-side first, and the Home administration region will appear in the navigation again

When you upload a plugin that uses the Home administration region, a new panel option will appear under the region that provides the plugin's associated functionality or configuration controls.
