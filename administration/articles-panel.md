# Articles panel

The Articles panel shows a list of all your existing articles with an overview of each article's metadata, including the author, publication time and date, assigned section, and any categories.

On this page:

* [Create a new article](#create-a-new-article)
* [Search function](#search-function)
* [List of articles](#list-of-articles)
  * [Perform changes on selected articles](#perform-changes-on-selected-articles)
* [Pages and articles listed per page](#pages-and-articles-listed-per-page)

On this panel you can do four things:

1. Open an article for editing
2. Perform bulk changes on selected articles
3. Search articles
4. Change the column display options

## Create a new article

This button will take you directly to the [Write panel](/administration/write-panel).

## Search function

Because the article list can get pretty long, a search function is available at the top of the list. You can use the search function to locate an article directly by a search phrase or to filter the view on existing articles by particular criteria, thus reducing the number of articles in the resulting list.

The Search function has two components:

1. A text field for entering the search query
2. A drop-down list to specify which area is to be searched

Query text entered in the search box will be treated as a *complete phrase* (e.g. "time stamp" will find exactly that. Text containing only "time" or "stamp", "time, stamp" or "timestamp" will not be in the results).

You don't need to wildcard query text at the beginning or the end (e.g. "time" will find "parttime", "times", "timestamp" as well). But you can use wildcard '?' within a query.

After entering your search criteria you start searching by selecting the search button. As a result you will be given a new list of articles which meet the criteria.

As a default the search will find matches for all criteria. But you can do more refined searches by selecting another area to search in via the drop-down list toggle button.

**Examples:** You can search (or list) an article by its ID number or date posted. You can list all articles of an author, you don't need the full author ID. Choose 'Author' and typing "adm" possibly is enough for the admin (provided no other author has "adm" in their ID). You can list all 'Drafts' (choose 'Status' and type "dr").

## List of articles

Beneath the search area there is the table, or list, of existing articles. Each row is one article. If you select the header of a column, it will sort the list according to that column. Select again to reverse sort direction.

### Perform changes on selected articles

In the first column you will find a checkbox for each article. Here you can select articles you want to change in a bulk manner. You can mark articles by checking the checkbox or you can use the checkbox in the head bar of the list to mark all articles on that page.

In order to quickly select ranges of articles select the checkbox of the first article you want to mark, press and hold the Shift key, then select the checkbox of the last article in the range. All articles between will be checked too. You can add ranges to your selection by repeating these steps.

For performing changes now you go to the drop-down list 'With selectedâ€¦' and choose the function you want to perform. After selecting the options you want to perform press 'Go' to start the changes.

## Pages and articles listed per page

At the very bottom of the list you will find a pagination and links for next and previous pages if there are more pages. You can also change the number of articles listed per page by selecting another value from the number range.
