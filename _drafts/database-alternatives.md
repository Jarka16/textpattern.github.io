# Database alternatives

Textpattern is intended to be run on a web server with PHP and a MySQL database engine. Some web hosting environments offer derivatives and alternatives to Oracle MySQL, while maintaining compatibility to a greater or lesser extent. While these database engines are not officially supported, field reports from Textpattern administrators are summarised below to assist in gauging whether a given environment is suitable for running Textpattern.
